1. Stay calm, make person sit or lie down.
2. Press clean cloth or bandage gently but firmly on the wound.
3. If cloth soaks, place another one on top (don’t remove first one).
4. Keep head raised slightly if possible.
5. If wound is deep, bleeding heavy, or person feels dizzy → call emergency.

**Don’ts:** Do not press hard if you suspect skull fracture (bone showing, soft spot, severe swelling). Do not wash deep head wounds.
